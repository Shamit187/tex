We propose metrics to characterize the output of any summarization algorithm. We investigate two approaches to address this problem. The first approach is an adaptation of clustering and the second approach makes use of frequent itemsets from the association analysis domain. We illustrate one application of summarization in the field of network data where we show how our technique can be effectively used to summarize network traffic into a compact but meaningful representation. Specifically, we evaluate our proposed algorithms on the 1998 DARPA Off-Line Intrusion Detection Evaluation data and network data generated by SKAION Corp for the ARDA information assurance program.}, number={33}, journal={Knowledge and Information Systems}, publisher={Springer}, author={Chandola, Varun and Kumar, Vipin}, year={2006}, month=oct, pages={355–378}, language={En} }

Values are inserted, deleted or updated; rows appear and disappear; columns are added or repurposed, etc. In such a dynamic situation, users might have many questions related to changes in the dataset, for instance which parts of the data are trustworthy and which are not? Users will wonder: How many changes have there been in the recent minutes, days or years? What kind of changes were made at which points of time? How dirty is the data? Is data cleansing required? The fact that data changed can hint at diﬀerent hidden processes or agendas: a frequently crowd-updated city name may be controversial; a person whose name has been recently changed may be the target of vandalism; and so on. We show various use cases that beneﬁt from recognizing and exploring such change.}, number={2}, journal={Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment}, author={Bleifuß, Tobias and Bornemann, Leon and Johnson, Theodore and Kalashnikov, Dmitri V. and Naumann, Felix and Srivastava, Divesh}, year={2018}, month=oct, pages={85–98}, language={en} }

@article{He_Meliou_Fariha_2024, title={ChARLES: Change-Aware Recovery of Latent Evolution Semantics in Relational Data}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18386}, DOI={10.48550/arXiv.2409.18386}, abstractNote={Data-driven decision-making is at the core of many modern applications, and understanding the data is critical in supporting trust in these decisions. However, data is dynamic and evolving, just like the real-world entities it represents. Thus, an important component of understanding data is analyzing and drawing insights from the changes it undergoes. Existing methods for exploring data change list differences exhaustively, which are not interpretable by humans and lack salient insights regarding change trends. For example, an explanation that semantically summarizes changes to highlight gender disparities in performance rewards is more human-consumable than a long list of employee salary changes. We demonstrate ChARLES, a system that derives semantic summaries of changes between two snapshots of an evolving database, in an effective, concise, and interpretable way. Our key observation is that, while datasets often evolve through point and other small-batch updates, rich data features can reveal latent semantics that can intuitively summarize the changes. Under the hood, ChARLES compares database versions, infers feasible transformations by fitting multiple regression lines over different data partitions to derive change summaries, and ranks them. ChARLES allows users to customize it to obtain their preferred explanation by navigating the accuracy-interpretability tradeoff, and offers a proof of concept for reasoning about data evolution over real-world datasets.}, note={arXiv:2409.18386 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2409.18386}, publisher={arXiv}, author={He, Shiyi and Meliou, Alexandra and Fariha, Anna}, year={2024}, month=sept }

However, data changes over time. These changes may reveal patterns or groups of similar values, properties, and entities. We study changes in large, publicly available data repositories by modelling them as time series and clustering these series by their similarity. In order to perform change exploration on real-world data we use the publicly available revision data of Wikipedia Infoboxes and weekly snapshots of IMDB.The changes to the data are captured as events, which we call change records. In order to extract temporal behavior we count changes in time periods and propose a general transformation framework that aggregates groups of changes to numerical time series of different resolutions. We use these time series to study different application scenarios of unsupervised clustering. Our explorative results show that changes made to collaboratively edited data sources can help find characteristic behavior, distinguish entities or properties and provide insight into the respective domains.}, number={22}, journal={Datenbank-Spektrum}, publisher={Springer}, author={Bornemann, Leon and Bleifuß, Tobias and Kalashnikov, Dmitri and Naumann, Felix and Srivastava, Divesh}, year={2018}, month=may, pages={79–87}, language={En} }

In this paper, we present a key component of our system that characterizes the information content of a cell based on a user’s prior familiarity with the cube and provides a context-sensitive exploration of the cube. There are three main modules of this component. A Tracker, that continuously tracks the parts of the cube that a user has visited. A Modeler, that pieces together the information in the visited parts to model the user’s expected values in the unvisited parts. An Informer, that processes user’s queries about the most informative unvisited parts of the cube. The mathematical basis for the expected value modeling is provided by the classical maximum entropy principle. Accordingly, the expected values are computed so as to agree with every value that is already visited while reducing assumptions about unvisited values to the minimum by maximizing their entropy. The most informative values are defined as those that bring the new expected values closest to the actual values. We believe and prove through experiments that such a user-in-the-loop exploration will enable much faster assimilation of all significant information in the data compared to existing manual explorations.}, number={22}, journal={The VLDB Journal}, publisher={Springer}, author={Sarawagi, Sunita}, year={2001}, month=sept, pages={224–239}, language={En} }

@article{Joglekar_Garcia-Molina_Parameswaran_2019, title={Interactive Data Exploration with Smart Drill-Down}, volume={31}, ISSN={1558-2191}, DOI={10.1109/TKDE.2017.2685998}, abstractNote={We present smart drill-down, an operator for interactively exploring a relational table to discover and summarize “interesting” groups of tuples. Each group of tuples is described by a rule . For instance, the rule (a, b, star, 1000) tells us that there are 1,000 tuples with value a in the first column and b in the second column (and any value in the third column). Smart drill-down presents an analyst with a list of rules that together describe interesting aspects of the table. The analyst can tailor the definition of interesting, and can interactively apply smart drill-down on an existing rule to explore that part of the table. We demonstrate that the underlying optimization problems are NP-Hard, and describe an algorithm for finding the approximately optimal list of rules to display when the user uses a smart drill-down, and a dynamic sampling scheme for efficiently interacting with large tables. Finally, we perform experiments on real datasets on our experimental prototype to demonstrate the usefulness of smart drill-down and study the performance of our algorithms.}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering}, author={Joglekar, Manas and Garcia-Molina, Hector and Parameswaran, Aditya}, year={2019}, month=jan, pages={46–60} }
